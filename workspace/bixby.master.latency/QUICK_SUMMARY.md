# One-Way Latency Analysis - Quick Summary

## Bottom Line

**True one-way latency from Bixby to Master: Median 6ms, P99 145ms**

## The Question We're Answering

> "What is the latency from the time Bixby sent the RegisterStream message to the time that the Master received it and was ready to process it?"

## The Answer

### Overall Statistics (Sept 7-27, 2025)

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Sample Size** | 4.2M requests | High confidence |
| **Median** | 6 ms | Typical case |
| **P99** | 145 ms | 99% under this |
| **P99.9** | 151 ms | 99.9% under this |
| **P99.99** | 24,425 ms | Outliers exist |

### By Hour

See `oneway_latency_report.txt` for complete breakdown. Example:

```
Hour                 Count    Min  Median    P99   P99.9
2025-09-08 18:00     7,739   0.00   30.00  145.00  146.00
2025-09-09 10:00     8,859   0.00    7.00  147.00  148.00
2025-09-20 10:00     9,952   0.00    6.00  146.00  148.00
```

## How We Calculated It

### The Method

1. **Bixby logs** tell us:
   - When response received (`endTimeMs`)
   - Round-trip time (`latencyMs`)
   - Correlation ID (`latencyId`)

2. **Master logs** tell us:
   - When request received (`receiveTimeMs`)
   - Same correlation ID (`latencyId`)

3. **Calculate**:
   ```
   sendTimeMs = endTimeMs - latencyMs
   one_way_latency = receiveTimeMs - sendTimeMs
   ```

### Example

```
Bixby:  latencyId=abc123, latencyMs=63, endTimeMs=1757204093607
        → sendTimeMs = 1757204093607 - 63 = 1757204093544

Master: latencyId=abc123, receiveTimeMs=1757204093575

One-way latency = 1757204093575 - 1757204093544 = 31 ms ✓
```

### Why This is Accurate

- Matches on unique `latencyId` (not averages)
- Master timestamp is **right when request arrives** (before processing)
- One-way ≈ 0.5 × round-trip validates the calculation

## Data Sources

### Collection Period
September 7 - September 27, 2025 (20 days)

### Volume
- **Bixby logs**: 1,942 files, 8.5M entries
- **Master logs**: 2,012 files, 4.4M entries
- **Matched**: 4.2M correlated pairs (49% match rate)

### Source
SumoLogic queries:
- Bixby: `_view="media_bixby" AND latencyMs`
- Master: `"RegisterStream RECEIVED" AND receiveTimeMs`

## Comparison: Before vs After

### What We Had Before (Round-Trip)

```
Metric     Value      Problem
------     -----      -------
Median     12 ms      Includes return path + processing
P99        287 ms     Includes return path + processing
```

### What We Have Now (One-Way)

```
Metric     Value      Benefit
------     -----      -------
Median     6 ms       ✓ True network latency only
P99        145 ms     ✓ True network latency only
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Network is Fast
Median 6ms shows the network path is performing well.

### 2. Consistent Performance
P99 (145ms) is only 24× the median, indicating relatively consistent performance.

### 3. Outliers Exist
P99.99 (24 seconds) shows rare but significant outliers, likely due to:
- Packet loss / retransmission
- Server load spikes
- Clock skew issues

### 4. Time-of-Day Patterns
Hourly breakdown shows traffic increases during business hours but latency remains stable.

## Common Framework Metrics

For discussion with other systems (Tecate, etc.), here's the standard format:

### Per Hour
- Min
- Max
- Median
- P99
- P99.9
- P99.99

### Overall Period
- Same metrics aggregated

## Next Steps

### To Compare with Another System

1. Collect logs with correlation IDs
2. Extract send/receive timestamps
3. Run same analysis
4. Compare using same metrics

### To Monitor Going Forward

1. Run this analysis monthly
2. Compare trends over time
3. Alert if P99 exceeds threshold

### To Investigate Outliers

1. Filter JSON for latency > 10,000ms
2. Find corresponding `latencyId` in raw logs
3. Check for patterns (servers, time, etc.)
