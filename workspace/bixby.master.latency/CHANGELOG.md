# Changelog

## 2025-10-24 - Code Cleanup & DRY Refactoring

### Changes Made

**1. Removed Redundant Scripts**
- ‚ùå Deleted `fill_gaps.js` (342 lines)
- ‚ùå Deleted `check_and_fill_gaps.sh` (73 lines)
- **Reason**: Download scripts now handle gap filling automatically

**2. Extracted Common Code (DRY)**
- ‚úÖ Created `download_lib.js` (340 lines) - shared download logic
- ‚úÖ Refactored `download_chunks.js`: 340 lines ‚Üí 19 lines (94% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Refactored `download_master_chunks.js`: 360 lines ‚Üí 19 lines (95% reduction)

**3. Improved Download Scripts**
- Auto-skip existing chunks (idempotent, safe to re-run)
- `--force` flag to override and re-download all
- Shows clear progress: ‚è≠Ô∏è for skipped, üì¶ for downloaded
- Summary reports: skipped vs new downloads

### Code Metrics

**Before:**
- Total lines: ~1,155 lines across 4 scripts
- Duplication: ~95% code overlap between download scripts
- Gap filling: Separate complex workflow

**After:**
- Total lines: ~378 lines across 3 scripts (67% reduction)
- Duplication: 0% (all common code in shared lib)
- Gap filling: Just re-run download scripts

### Benefits

‚úÖ **Simpler**: One workflow for initial download and gap filling
‚úÖ **DRY**: Common code extracted to shared module
‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Changes to download logic happen in one place
‚úÖ **Safer**: Idempotent operations, no risk of duplication
‚úÖ **Faster**: Skip existing files instantly

### Usage

**Before:**
```bash
# Complex multi-step process
./detect_gaps.py latency.study/bixby_logs
./fill_gaps.js gap_analysis_bixby_logs.json
# or
./check_and_fill_gaps.sh latency.study/bixby_logs --fill
```

**After:**
```bash
# Simple: just re-run the download script
cd latency.study && ./download_chunks.js
```

### Migration Notes

- No changes needed to existing data files
- Download scripts work exactly the same way for end users
- New `download_lib.js` module can be reused for future downloaders
- Old gap-filling scripts removed (no longer needed)
