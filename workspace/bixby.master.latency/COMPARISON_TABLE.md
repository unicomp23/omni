| Hour | Count | Min | Median | Max | P99 | P99.9 | P99.99 |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-----|-----|-------|--------|
| 2025-09-07 00:00 | 3,242 | 0.00 | 2.00 | 70.00 | 64.00 | 65.00 | 70.00 |

**Typical High-Traffic Pattern**:
- Count: 17,000-21,000 requests/hour
- Median: 12-14 ms
- P99: 240-295 ms
- P99.9: 280-300 ms

## For Your Presentation

### One-Way Latency Estimation
If Redpanda measurements are one-way, divide Bixby measurements by 2 for rough comparison:

| Metric | Round-Trip | Estimated One-Way (√∑2) |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| **Median** | 12.000 ms | ~6.000 ms |
| **P99** | 287.000 ms | ~143.500 ms |
| **P99.9** | 296.000 ms | ~148.000 ms |
| **P99.99** | 1,091.510 ms | ~545.755 ms |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat**: This is an approximation. For accurate one-way latency, Master server logs are needed.

## Questions to Ask About Redpanda Metrics

1. **What is measured?**
   - Producer ‚Üí Broker (one-way)?
   - Producer ‚Üí Broker ‚Üí Ack (round-trip)?

2. **What percentiles are reported?**
   - Ensure comparing P99, P99.9, P99.99

3. **What was the test duration?**
   - Compare similar time windows

4. **What was the request rate?**
   - Compare similar load levels (our high-traffic: ~17-21k req/hour)

5. **Are outliers included?**
   - Our data includes all measurements, including extreme spikes

## Key Talking Points

‚úÖ **Stable median performance**: 12-14ms round-trip under high load
‚úÖ **Consistent P99**: 240-295ms across most hours
‚úÖ **High throughput sustained**: 17,000-21,000 req/hour
‚ö†Ô∏è **Occasional spikes**: P99.99 can reach 1-30 seconds (investigation needed)
üìä **Large dataset**: 8.5M samples over 20 days provides statistical confidence
