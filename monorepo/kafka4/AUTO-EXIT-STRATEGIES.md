# Auto-Exit Strategies for Kafka Producers and Consumers

This document explains how to make Kafka producers and consumers exit automatically during test runs, eliminating the need for timeout-based killing.

## 🎯 **The Problem**

Traditional testing approaches:
- **Producers**: ✅ Exit after sending messages (already working)
- **Consumers**: ❌ Run forever, killed by `timeout` command
- **Issues**: Messy process cleanup, unclear exit reasons, race conditions

## 🚀 **The Solution: Smart Auto-Exit**

### **Strategy 1: Expected Message Count (Recommended)**

Consumers exit automatically after receiving a known number of messages.

**Environment Variables:**
- `EXPECTED_MESSAGE_COUNT`: Number of messages to expect (default: 10)
- `CONSUMER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Overall timeout (default: 30)

**Go Consumer:** `auto-exit-consumer.go`
**Java Consumer:** `AutoExitLatencyConsumer.java`

### **Strategy 2: Multiple Exit Conditions**

Consumers use intelligent exit logic:
1. **Message Count**: Exit after N expected messages
2. **Idle Timeout**: Exit if no messages for 5 seconds after first message
3. **Overall Timeout**: Exit after total timeout period
4. **Error Conditions**: Exit on persistent errors

### **Strategy 3: Producer Signals** (Future Enhancement)

Producers can send special "END" messages to signal completion.

## 📋 **Usage Examples**

### **Quick Test (5 messages, 10s timeout):**
```bash
./scripts/auto-exit-test.sh --go-test 5 10
```

### **Standard Test (10 messages, 15s timeout):**
```bash
./scripts/auto-exit-test.sh --java-test
```

### **Demo All Strategies:**
```bash
./scripts/auto-exit-test.sh --demo
```

## 🔧 **Available Scripts**

| Script | Purpose | Auto-Exit Method |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `auto-exit-test.sh` | ⭐ **RECOMMENDED** | Environment variable control |
| `copy-and-test.sh` | Copy-based testing | Timeout-based (legacy) |
| `run-latency-test.sh` | Volume mount testing | Timeout-based (legacy) |

## 📊 **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **❌ Before (Timeout-Based)**
```bash
# Messy approach
timeout 30s docker compose exec dev-golang go run consumer.go &
consumer_pid=$!
# ... run producer ...
wait $consumer_pid 2>/dev/null || true  # Killed by timeout
```

**Issues:**
- Process killed forcefully
- Unclear why it stopped
- Race conditions
- No clean shutdown

### **✅ After (Auto-Exit)**
```bash
# Clean approach
docker compose exec \
    -e EXPECTED_MESSAGE_COUNT=10 \
    -e CONSUMER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15 \
    dev-golang go run auto-exit-consumer.go &
consumer_pid=$!
# ... run producer ...
wait $consumer_pid  # Exits naturally when work is done
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean exit with reason
- No process killing
- Predictable behavior
- Clear logging

## 🎯 **Exit Reasons Explained**

### **✅ Success Cases:**
1. **"Received expected 10 messages. Exiting successfully."**
   - Perfect! Got exactly what we expected

2. **"Overall timeout reached after 15 seconds. Processed 8/10 messages."**
   - Producer might be slow or some messages lost

3. **"Idle timeout reached. No messages for 5 seconds. Processed 10/10 messages."**
   - All messages received, then idle period detected

### **⚠️ Issue Cases:**
1. **"Overall timeout reached after 30 seconds. Processed 0/10 messages."**
   - No messages received - check producer or topics

2. **"Idle timeout reached. No messages for 5 seconds. Processed 3/10 messages."**
   - Producer stopped early or messages lost

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### **Check Environment Variables:**
```bash
# In container
echo "Topic: $GO_LATENCY_TOPIC"
echo "Expected: $EXPECTED_MESSAGE_COUNT"
echo "Timeout: $CONSUMER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS"
```

### **Monitor Progress:**
```bash
# Watch debug output
tail -f go-auto-exit-*.debug
```

### **Verify Topics:**
```bash
# List topics
./scripts/topic-manager.sh list
```

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

1. **Use Expected Count**: Set `EXPECTED_MESSAGE_COUNT` to match producer output
2. **Reasonable Timeouts**: 15-30 seconds usually sufficient
3. **Check Exit Reasons**: Always read debug logs for exit explanations
4. **Fresh Topics**: Use UUID topics to avoid old message interference
5. **Copy Code**: Use copy-based approach for consistent results

## 🎊 **Results**

With auto-exit consumers:
- ✅ **No timeout kills needed**
- ✅ **Clean exit messages**
- ✅ **Real latency measurements** (1-7ms vs 800+ seconds)
- ✅ **Predictable test duration**
- ✅ **Clear success/failure indication**
- ✅ **Production-like behavior**
