## 8. Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Alerts
1. **🚨 Critical (>5s)** - Immediate escalation
2. **🔴 Slow (100ms-5s)** - Operations team notification  
3. **⚠️ Elevated (10-100ms)** - Trend monitoring
4. **📊 Orphan rate >1%** - Data integrity alert

### Performance SLAs
- **95% of requests** should complete under 10ms
- **99% of requests** should complete under 100ms
- **99.9% of requests** should complete under 1000ms
- **Zero tolerance** for >5s responses (except during attacks)

### Security Monitoring
- **Vulnerability scan detection** - Block common attack patterns
- **Response time monitoring** - Alert on security-related slow responses
- **404 pattern analysis** - Identify coordinated attack attempts
- **Rate limiting effectiveness** - Monitor 429 response patterns

---

## 9. Conclusion

The system demonstrates **exceptional performance** with 76.2% of responses under 10ms and a 99.98% success rate across **193,536 transactions**. The **critical security incident** (6.95s Sitecore scan) highlights the need for enhanced security monitoring and WAF implementation.

**Immediate priorities:** Address the security vulnerability scanning, optimize the allocate_subscribe endpoint, and improve DELETE operation performance. The system is performing at **enterprise scale** with room for optimization in specific areas.

**Next steps:** Implement security hardening, establish real-time monitoring for >5s responses, and continue optimizing the slowest 3.2% of transactions to achieve sub-100ms performance across 99%+ of requests.
