Description

Try suggestions provided by AWS regarding ways to improve performance of MSK at the extremes.

Acceptance Conditions
Formulate a strategy for testing the various options that AWS suggested.

See if there is a way to simulate or trigger disruptive events to measure the impact on performance.

Try different configurations in short tests to see how they perform.

If we have a candidate configuration we think might work, repeat the long (21 day) test.
